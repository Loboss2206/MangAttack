# MangAttack

Hello everyone!

Welcome to my project MangAttack, where I took on the challenge of recreating an online store dedicated to manga. It was a challenge in the sense that my web design skills were relatively low at the beginning of this project, and I believe I've improved greatly throughout (it's all relative). Nonetheless, I've tried to create something that manga fans will appreciate.

## üíª Key Features

MangAttack is a project aimed at replicating key features of an online manga store, including:

- Displaying a list of manga with images, titles, and descriptions.
- Category pages to explore different genres of manga.
- Detail pages for each manga with in-depth information.
- Shopping cart allowing users to add manga and complete purchases.

## üéØ Objectives

The main objectives of this project are as follows:

1. **Web Design:** Deepening and applying web design concepts to create an attractive and user-friendly interface.

2. **Front-End Development:** Enhancing my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make the website interactive and responsive.

3. **Back-End Development:** Enhancing my skills in PHP, particularly to make the site functional in addition to being attractive.

4. **Database Integration (DB):** Setting up a database to store information about manga and users.

5. **Project Management:** Planning development stages, setting milestones, and adhering to a realistic schedule.

## üîß Project Structure

The structure of the MangAttack project is as follows:

- **admin.php:** Administration page to manage manga and users (optional).
- **cart.php:** Shopping cart page to view and manage selected items.
- **category.php:** Category pages to explore different genres of manga.
